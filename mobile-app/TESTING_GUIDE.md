### 🐛 **Known Limitations**

Since this is a **mock data implementation**:

1. **No Real API**: All data is generated locally
2. **No Real Authentication**: Login works with any credentials
3. **No Real Upload**: Video/image upload is simulated
4. **No Real Push Notifications**: Notifications are simulated
5. **Data Resets**: All changes reset when app restarts
6. **No Real Sharing**: Share functionality shows mock dialogs

### 🚀 **Next Steps for Real Implementation**

To make this a production app, you would need to:

1. **Backend API**: Implement real REST API endpoints
2. **Database**: Set up real database (Firebase, PostgreSQL, etc.)
3. **Authentication**: Implement real OAuth/social login
4. **File Storage**: Set up real file upload (AWS S3, Firebase Storage)
5. **Push Notifications**: Implement real FCM notifications
6. **Real-time**: Set up WebSocket server for chat
7. **CDN**: Set up content delivery for videos/images

### 💡 **Testing Tips**

1. **Console Logs**: Check console for mock data generation logs
2. **Different Users**: Test with different mock user accounts
3. **Edge Cases**: Try extreme values, empty inputs, etc.
4. **Performance**: Test with large amounts of mock data
5. **Accessibility**: Test with screen readers and accessibility tools
