## Episode List Features

### For TV Series
- Shows episode labels: `S01E01`, `S01E02`, etc.
- Groups by season automatically
- Displays episode thumbnails

### For Movies/Shorts
- Shows as `File 1`, `File 2`, etc.
- Useful for multiple quality versions or extras
- Behind-the-scenes, teasers, etc.

### Visual Indicators
- **Red border**: Currently playing episode
- **Play icon overlay**: On current episode thumbnail
- **Gray background**: Unplayed episodes

## Backend Integration

### Stream URL Flow
1. Player requests stream URL for episode
2. Backend calls uloz.to API
3. Returns direct stream link
4. Player initializes video with URL
5. Caches URL in database for future use

### API Endpoint
```
GET /api/v1/movies/{movieId}/episodes/{episodeId}/stream

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "streamUrl": "https://download.greencdn.link/..."
  }
}
```

## Video Controls

### Tap Behaviors
- **Single tap on video**: Toggle controls visibility
- **Tap play/pause button**: Control playback
- **Tap progress bar**: Seek to position
- **Tap episode thumbnail**: Switch to that episode
- **Tap back button**: Close player and return to detail screen

### Auto-Hide Logic
- Controls visible for 3 seconds when playing
- Stays visible when paused
- Reappears on tap

## State Management

### Player State
- `_isVideoInitialized`: Video ready to play
- `_isPlaying`: Currently playing or paused
- `_showControls`: Controls visible or hidden
- `_isLoading`: Loading new episode
- `_currentEpisodeId`: Currently playing episode ID

### Episode Loading
```dart
Future<void> _loadEpisode(MovieEpisode episode) async {
  1. Set loading state
  2. Dispose previous video controller
  3. Get stream URL from backend
  4. Initialize new video controller
  5. Start playback
  6. Update UI
}
```

## Error Handling

### Scenarios Handled
1. **Stream URL unavailable**: Shows error snackbar
2. **Video initialization fails**: Displays error message
3. **Network timeout**: Shows loading indefinitely (user can go back)
4. **Movie not found**: Error screen with back button

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. **URL Caching**
Backend caches stream URLs in database:
- Valid for 48 hours
- Reduces API calls to uloz.to
- Faster episode switching

### 2. **Controller Disposal**
Properly disposes video controller:
- Prevents memory leaks
- Frees resources when switching episodes
- Cleans up on screen exit

### 3. **Lazy Loading**
- Only loads stream when episode is selected
- Doesn't preload all episodes
- Saves bandwidth
